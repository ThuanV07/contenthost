			"description": "In this lesson you learn about the fundamentals of Spanish where you learn the alphabet as well as basic Spanish phrases and sentences. The Spanish alphabet contains 27 letters. It has one more letter than the English alphabet—Ñ. Each letter is pronounced very differently, where each pronunciation is shown in the referenced image.\n\nSpanish shares many familiar words with English: 'I' is 'yo', 'in' is 'en', 'is' is 'es', and 'am' is 'soy'. Other core vocabulary includes 'he' (él), 'she' (ella), and 'Spanish' (español). These words combine similarly to English. For example, 'I am in Spanish' translates word-for-word as 'Yo soy en español'.\n\nHowever, Spanish uses verb conjugation rules, so just like 'he am' is incorrect in English, 'Él soy' is incorrect in Spanish. Instead, you say 'He is' → 'Él es'. At the beginning stage of learning Spanish, word-for-word translations are often possible, but it’s important to recognize grammatical agreements like conjugation.",

			"description": "In this lesson you will learn that there are conjugations in Spanish just like in English. In Spanish, there are three types of verbs that have different endings: AR, ER, and IR verbs. When used in a sentence, the verb endings change depending on the subject. For example, if you want to say 'I eat' in Spanish, you take the verb 'comer' (to eat) and conjugate it as 'como', resulting in 'Yo como.' This lesson focuses only on present tense conjugations.\n\nSome common Spanish verbs are: ser (to be - permanent), estar (to be - temporary), tener (to have), hacer (to do/make), ir (to go), poder (to be able/can), saber (to know - facts), poner (to put), haber (to have - auxiliary/helping verb), querer (to want/love), decir (to say/tell), hablar (to speak), dar (to give), ver (to see), comer (to eat), tomar (to take/drink), vivir (to live), necesitar (to need), quedar (to stay/remain/be left), and venir (to come).\n\nFor this lesson, focus on the regular verbs: hablar, comer, tomar, vivir, necesitar, and quedar. These follow standard conjugation patterns and are ideal for learning how to form present-tense sentences.",

You’ll focus on two essential regular verbs: comer (to eat) and beber (to drink), and learn how to conjugate them in the present tense using food-related vocabulary.\n\nFor example, just as you learned in the previous lesson, the verb form changes depending on the subject. So, 'You eat hamburgers' becomes 'Tú comes hamburguesas.'\n\nSome key vocabulary words introduced in this lesson include: leche (milk), agua (water), hamburguesa (hamburger), and manzana (apple).\n\nYou’ll also learn additional food vocabulary like: pan (bread), arroz (rice), pollo (chicken), carne (meat), pescado (fish), huevo (egg), queso (cheese), plátano (banana), naranja (orange), fresa (strawberry), ensalada (salad), papas/patatas (potatoes), verduras (vegetables), tomate (tomato), cebolla (onion), ajo (garlic), frijoles (beans), sopa (soup), jugo/zumo (juice), refresco (soda), helado (ice cream), torta/pastel (cake), and galleta (cookie).\n\nYou’ll use familiar conjugation patterns and combine them with new vocabulary to express real-life situations involving meals and drinks.",

The conjugation process mirrors what you've learned in previous lessons—changing the verb to match the subject and applying it to the correct noun. For example: 'He opens the door' becomes 'Él abre la puerta.'\n\nAdditional vocabulary includes items you’re likely to see around the house: mesa (table), silla (chair), sofá (sofa/couch), ventana (window), pared (wall), techo (ceiling/roof), piso (floor), baño (bathroom), cocina (kitchen), refrigerador (refrigerator), microondas (microwave), horno (oven), lavaplatos (dishwasher), fregadero (sink), espejo (mirror), ducha (shower), inodoro (toilet), toalla (towel), televisor (TV), lámpara (lamp), alfombra (carpet/rug), cortina (curtain), cuadro (picture/frame), ropa (clothes), armario (closet), cajón (drawer), escoba (broom), and aspiradora (vacuum cleaner).\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to describe actions and objects commonly found in a home using basic Spanish sentence structures.",
